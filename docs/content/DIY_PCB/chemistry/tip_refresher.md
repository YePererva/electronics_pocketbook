# Soldering tip cleaner 

a.k.a. Tip tinners

## For nickel-plated tips

In a nutshell, it is a mix of solder powder (per say tin or any other alloy) with ammonium phosphate(s), sometimes with extra bonding compound. This is similar to market products:

- ThermalTronics TMT-TC-2, [MSDS](https://www.thermaltronics.com/downloads/datasheets/TMT-TC-2_Material_Safety_Datasheet.pdf)
- GOOT BS-2, [Store page](https://en.goot.jp/products/detail/bs_2)
- Mechanic MCN 8, MSDS not found
- SOLINS ТТС-20, MSDS not found, contains bonding compound
- Jaston JSD-40A, MSDS not found
- YAXUN YX-B2

Example of compositions (by mass):

- 55 (±10) % of alloy in rest of diammonium phosphate `(NH₄)₂HPO₄`
- 30 (±10) % of alloy + 1 ... 6 % of paraffin wax in ammonium dihydrogen phosphate `(NH₄)H₂PO₄` (60...75%)

Application:

1. Preheat the tip to 300°C-360°C (double-check with manufacturer instructions)
2. If needed, pre-clean by wiping with metal sponge
3. Rub the tip in the refresher/tinner
4. Apply solder to the tip, and clean the tip with the sponge of the soldering iron stand
5. Apply solder again
