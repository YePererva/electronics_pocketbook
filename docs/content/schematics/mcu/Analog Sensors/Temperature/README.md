# Temperature sensors with voltage output


To ensure the uniform precision all-over the measurable temperature range, manufacturers are trying to make sensors with linear correlation. Thus, the voltage into temperature cam be recalculated based on formula:

$$
Temperature = 
$$

where:

- `Offset` : a voltage level generated by sensor when the measurable value is equal to some zero level (for temperature it can be 0°C)
- `Coeficient` : a proportional value used to convert the voltage into units of measured value (Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit, etc.) A lot of sensors have a reciprocal to coefficient value, mentioned in datasheets and it is called “Scale factor” – a voltage generated by sensor per each unit of measured property: $$ Coeficient = \frac{1}{Scale \ factor}$$

## Examples

### TMP35

Very close to popular in “Arduino community” LM35 sensor, but TMP35 can work with 3.3V power supply. Generates 10 mV per each 1°C measured, starting with 0 mV at 0°C. Thus:
$$
Offset = 0 \ [mV] = 0 \ [V]
$$
$$
Scale \ factor = 10 \frac{mV}{\degree C}=10^{-2}\frac{V}{\degree C}
$$
And temperature can be calculated based on formula:

$$
T_{\\degree C}=\frac{V_{input}-Offset}{Scale factor}=\frac{V_{input}-0V}{10^{-2} \frac{V}{℃}}=100 \times V_{input} \ []
$$

### TMP36

Unlike TMP35 or LM35, this sensor has an offset, that allows us to measure the negative temperature without using any differential ADC readings.

It generates 10 $mV$ per 1°C and has an offset of 500 $mV$ (it is “zeroed” at -50°C), thus:

$$
Offset = 500 \ [mV] = 0.5 \ [V]
$$

$$
Scale \ factor = 10 \frac{mV}{\degree C}=10^{-2}\frac{V}{\degree C}
$$

And temperature can be calculated based on formula:
$$
T_{\degree C}=\frac{V_{input}-Offset}{Scale factor}=\frac{V_{input}-0.5 \ [V]}{10^{-2} \ [\frac{V}{℃}]}=100 \times V_{input} - 50 \ [℃]
$$

### LM35

Interesting sensor which has one peculiarity: it is calibrated on Kelvins scale, not Celsius scale. Thus, after reading values we can calculate the temperature in kelvins and there is need of extra conversion into Celsius. Also, this sensor has a higher precision, than TMP35/TMP36.

This sensor generates 10 $\frac{mV}{\degree K}$ starting with 0 $mV$ at 0 $K$:
